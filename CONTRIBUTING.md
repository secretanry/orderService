# Contributing to WB-L0

Thank you for your interest in contributing to WB-L0! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL (or use Docker)
- Redis (optional)
- Kafka (or use Docker)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/wb-L0.git
   cd wb-L0
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

4. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   go test ./...
   ```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
go test ./...

# Integration tests (requires Docker)
go test -tags=integration ./...

# Monitoring tests
go test ./monitoring_test.go

# Test with coverage
go test -cover ./...
```

### Test Requirements

- Integration tests require Docker containers for PostgreSQL, Redis, and Kafka
- Use `docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d` to start test services
- Tests will automatically clean up after completion

## üìù Code Style

### Go Code

- Follow [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)
- Use `gofmt` for formatting
- Run `golint` for code quality checks
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for exported functions and types

### Commit Messages

Use conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test changes
- `chore`: Build/tooling changes

Examples:
```
feat(monitoring): add Prometheus metrics collection
fix(handlers): resolve nil pointer dereference in order retrieval
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## üîß Development Workflow

### 1. Create Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Changes

- Write code following the style guidelines
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation if needed

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run specific tests
go test ./handlers/...

# Check for race conditions
go test -race ./...

# Run with monitoring
make monitoring-up
go test -tags=integration ./...
```

### 4. Commit and Push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(scope): your commit message"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 5. Create Pull Request
